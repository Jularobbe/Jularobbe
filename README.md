# Hey 👋

I’m Julian, a web developer currently working at [D3R](https://www.d3r.com/).

I’m currently focused on experimenting with AI tooling for real developer workflows; from coding assistants and embeddings to running lightweight text and image models locally.

## 🔭 Main interests

* Applied AI for software development
* AI-assisted coding and automation (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, openclawd)
* Embeddings, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* Local and hosted LLM (Large Language Model) workflows
* Multimodal experimentation (text + image models)

## 🤖 What I’m working on

* Using **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** for AI-assisted development
* Building custom agent workflows with **openclawd**
* Creating embedding pipelines for semantic search and knowledge indexing
* Running small local models for offline and privacy-first inference
* Testing prompt strategies and agent design patterns

## 🌱 Current areas of exploration

* AI-powered developer tooling
* Vector databases and embedding systems
* Local model serving and inference optimization
* Prompt engineering and multimodal AI
